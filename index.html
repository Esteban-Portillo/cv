            I'm an electrmechanical engineer and I have allways 
            wanted a place were to learn fast and 24/7, like a
            engenier student I had no much money to take big 
            courses and i didn't had the time to go to some classes 
            but I had the wonderfull night, yes  that time when 
            you can learn and you have your own schedule, but here
            in Bolivia we have no that, and the courses for us are 
            really bad in spanish there are soo few information, thats
            why I created PORTCAD, this academy onlyne where you can find 
            really goog information and with really good quality, of 
            course it have a price but is becouse the persons who make
            this courses have gain that information after a lot suffer
            and really long nights.
